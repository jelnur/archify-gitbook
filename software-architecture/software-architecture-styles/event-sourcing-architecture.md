# Event Sourcing Architecture

### **Definition**

Event Sourcing is an architectural pattern in which the state of an application is determined by a sequence of events that have occurred rather than just the current state. The events are captured, stored, and can be replayed to reconstruct the state of the application at any given point in time.

### **Advantages**

* **Historical analysis and auditing:** Event sourcing allows for easy auditing and analysis of past events as the entire sequence of events is captured and stored.
* **Time travel and rollbacks:** The ability to replay events enables the application to "time travel" and reconstruct past states, as well as roll back to a specific point in time.
* **Event-driven architecture:** Event sourcing naturally aligns with event-driven architectural patterns, allowing for loose coupling and scalability.
* **Scalability:** Event sourcing can handle high-throughput scenarios as storing events is typically a write-intensive operation that can be efficiently scaled.
* **Evolving and temporal models:** With event sourcing, the model and business logic of the application can evolve over time without losing historical data.

### **Disadvantages**

* **Complexity:** Implementing event sourcing requires additional complexity compared to traditional systems due to the need for event storage, replay, and state reconstruction.
* **Event schema evolution:** As the business requirements change, the schema of the events may also evolve, requiring proper version management strategies.
* **Read model complexity:** Constructing the current state of the application may involve complex read model implementations, especially for applications with large event logs.
* **Performance trade-offs:** Replay and reconstruction of the entire event log can introduce performance overhead, especially as the number of events grows.

### **Suitable Use Cases**

* **Domain-driven design:** Event sourcing complements Domain-Driven Design (DDD) by capturing the domain events and allowing for a more expressive model.
* **Audit trails and compliance:** Applications that require detailed auditing and compliance, where the history of events is crucial, can benefit from event sourcing.
* **Collaboration and synchronization:** Systems that require collaboration and synchronization across multiple components can leverage event sourcing to ensure consistency.

### **Non-suitable Use Cases**

* **Simple CRUD applications:** Event sourcing may introduce unnecessary complexity for applications that primarily deal with basic CRUD operations and do not require complex state management.
* **Real-time systems:** If an application requires immediate state updates and doesn't need to rely on historical data, event sourcing may not be the best fit.
* **Performance-critical systems:** In scenarios where extremely low-latency or high throughput is crucial, the overhead of event sourcing may not be suitable.
* **Data privacy and protection:** Applications that handle sensitive data or have strict data protection requirements may need to consider the challenges of managing event data and ensuring security.
