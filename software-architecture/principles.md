# Principles

* **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Emphasizes simplicity in design to avoid unnecessary complexity.
* **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):** Encourages developers to avoid adding features or functionality until it's proven necessary.
* **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Promotes code reusability by avoiding duplication of code.
* **Overengineering: D**esigning the system to be more complex or sophisticated than necessary, often resulting in unnecessary costs, resources, or complications.
* **Premature Optimization**: Optimizing code or processes before it is clear where optimization is truly needed, often resulting in wasted time and effort.
* **Separation of Concerns:** Divides a software system into distinct sections, each addressing a specific concern or functionality.
* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** A class or module should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one responsibility.
* **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
* **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
* **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
* **Law of Demeter (LoD):** A module should not be aware of the internal workings of the objects it interacts with.
* **Minimize Coupling and Maximize Cohesion:** Reduce dependencies between different components while ensuring strong connections within each component.
* **Principle of Least Astonishment (POLA):** Design should not surprise its users; it should behave as expected.
