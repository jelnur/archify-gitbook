# Software Architecture Styles

* [**Monolithic Architecture**](monolithic.md)**:** Single, self-contained application with all components tightly integrated.
* **Microservices Architecture:** Break down a system into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other.
* **Client-Server Architecture:** Divides processing tasks between client devices and a central server.
* **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** Organizes software as a collection of services that communicate through well-defined interfaces.
* **Event-Driven Architecture:** Components communicate through events, reacting to changes or triggers.
* **Layered Architecture:** Divides software into layers, each responsible for specific functionality.
* **Peer-to-Peer Architecture:** Allows individual devices to communicate and share resources directly.
* **N-Tier Architecture:** Distributes application processing across multiple layers or tiers for scalability.
* **Component-Based Architecture:** Constructs software from reusable, self-contained components.
* **Event Sourcing Architecture:** Stores all changes to the application state as a sequence of events.
* **Serverless Architecture:** Focuses on building applications without managing server infrastructure.
